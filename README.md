# bronze

A place where NFT utilities, sales mechanisms, and ideas are forged.

- Metadata utilities
- SVG render testing with cheatcodes
- NFT where minting price manipulates the supply.
- NFT where the block fee(?) has an effect on NFT "abilities" or design
- NFT returned as ticket, based on how much of an ERC20 you've deposited into contract. Redeemable for value after a time, or penalty if taken before.
